WEB3 INNOVATION

Distributed ledger technology (DLT) – generally referred to as blockchain – is picking up steam in terms of both enthusiasm and potential adoption

Blockchain and other have the potential to fundamentally transform a wide range of industries and to create new foundations for our economic and social systems.

Meanwhile, cryptocurrency is regarded a new dimension in the global economy  many major corporations and venture capital firms are pouring money into Web 3.0.

Web 3.0 is a next version of the internet based on public blockchains, a record-keeping system best known for facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. 
The attractiveness of Web 3.0 is that it is decentralized, meaning that rather than consumers accessing the internet through services mediated by companies like Google, Apple or Facebook, individuals, themselves, own and govern sections of the internet.
Web 3.0 doesn't require "permission," which means that central authorities don't get to decide who gets to access what services, nor does it require "trust," meaning that an intermediary isn't necessary for virtual transactions to occur between two or more parties. 
Because these agencies and intermediaries are doing most of the data collection, Web 3.0 technically protects user privacy better.

Decentralized finance, often known as DeFi, is a component of Web 3.0 that's gaining steam. It entails executing real-world financial transactions on the blockchain without the help of banks or the government.

Over the past 5 years, we have invested in Web 3.0 innvations and created various applications and contracts for DeFi, NFT, Metaverse, etc. We cover everything companies need to know about the globally changing communication, information and data interaction. At this very moment we have just started this innovative transition, with distributed or self-governed ownership. 

Compared with traditional software, blockchain applications (called 'smart contracts') have 3 major characteristics;
    1. all code is open and transparent
    2. immutable, meaning it can never be changed
    3. it runs forever

This means all code needs to be carefully unit tested and audited before deployment. One other important aspect of smart contracts is that it has a wallet address (like the users) and are capable of receiving, owning and sending assets, like tokens or NFT.

Our team has a leading role in innovating the Web 3.0 space. Wether it be creating DEX, farms, pools, launchpad or NFT earning games. We have an enthousiast group of innovators with contributing skills and background to create any new kind of blockchain powered application (DAPP) or token.
