POLICY, STRATEGY AND AUDIT

ICT is the fundamental backbone of any business that allows for potential growth and development in desired markets

It requires an ICT strategy that documents the business context, key initiatives, and strategic roadmap. To create a business-aligned ICT strategy, you must understand what the business does and what the business will need. Only then can a carefully thought-out, strategic and tactical plan be created for execution. 

Our specialists can help build ICT guiding principles, identify your key initiatives and build  profiles, construct your strategic roadmap, and evaluate your governance structures, budget, and organizational changes.

We can create a scan of the current ICT - infrastructure or do specific security audit. A Smart Contracts Audit for instance, is an examination and thorough testing of contracts code. The audit aims to uncover any errors, vulnerabilities and security issues. It is meant to establish wether the code meets its intended purpose anis robust and secure.

Another service our team offers is testing and analysing. We have an in-house developed standardized library of automated tools to provide industry-leading security recommendations for project teams.
